      <p className="text-center text-4xl font-light">
        I am a current Masters of Science Computer Science graduate student at the University of the Pacific.
         I currently work as a Research Assistant for the Robotics Lab at the UOP. 
         In the past, I have completed a CO-OP at Abbott Laboratories in Pleasanton, CA, where I worked on a class C implanted artificial heart.
         I have also interned at NTT Data in Tokyo, Japan, where I worked on developing a Generative Adversarial Network to synthetically create 
         datasets based on SAR satellite data. In the future, I aspire to leverage my expertise in AI and robotics to drive innovation.</p>
